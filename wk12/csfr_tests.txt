When I first ran csfr_form.php, it successfully logged in to the redirected page.
I think it is because we placed a hidden variable with the confirm value to be
compared to the session. The hidden value acted as comparison value for the session

When the csfr.html is ran alone, it won't log in. This is because I doesnt have a php session variable.
